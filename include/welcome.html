<p>
I am currently a researcher at the Nagoya Institute of Technology. I am working on sentiment analysis in discussion platform using NLP and agent technologies.
	
<p>
Previosly, I was a research fellow in the Department of Psychology (and Philosophy) at Monash University. My work was at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience and Philosophy, studying how cognitive abilities rise in humans, animals, and machines.
I was particularly working on 4E cognition, active inference, and the integrated information theory of consciousness.

<p>
Prior to joining Monash, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Nagoya Institute of Technology in Japan.
I worked on agent-based decision-making and large-scale multiagent simulation.

<p>
	I am interested in the following topics (amongst other things):

	<ul>
		<li>Sentiment analysis and consensus mechanisms in large-scale discussions.</li>
		<li>Artificial General Intelligence and formal models of general intelligence.</li>
		<li>Automated negotiation with nonlinear preferences.</li>
		<li>Multiagent simulation of complex systems: road traffic, discussions, mobility, etc.</li>
		<li>Enactive AI and constructivist epistemology.</li>
		<li>Machine Consciousness.</li>
	</ul>
