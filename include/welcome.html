<p>
In December 2020, I joined the Department of Social Informatics at Kyoto University.
</p>

<p>
From September 2019 to December 2020 I was a researcher at the Nagoya Institute of Technology. I worked on the development of argumentative conversational AI using Natural Language Processing/Generation techniques (LSTM, GAN), Sentiment Analysis, and Formal Argumentation.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I was a research fellow in the Department of Psychology (and Philosophy) at Monash University. My work was at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience and Philosophy, studying how cognitive abilities rise in humans, animals, and machines.
I was particularly working on 4E cognition, active inference, and the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Prior to joining Monash, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Nagoya Institute of Technology.
I worked on multiagent simulation of road traffic.

	I am interested in the following topics (amongst other things):

	<ul>
		<li>Multiagent modelling and simulation of complex systems:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Road traffic</li>
			<li>Online discussions</li>
			<li>Biological organisms</li>
		</ul>
			
		<li>Sentiment Analysis and Consensus Mechanisms in Online Discussions.</li>
		<li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Formal Models of Intelligence.</li>
		<li>Complex Automated Negotiation.</li>
		<li>Enactive AI and Constructivist Epistemology.</li>
		<li>Machine Consciousness.</li>
	</ul>
