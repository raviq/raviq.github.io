<p>

I am a research fellow in the Department of Psychology (and Philosophy) at Monash University since April 2017. <br>

My current work is at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience and Philosophy, studying how cognitive abilities rise in humans, animals, and machines.
I am particularly working on 4E cognition, active inference, and the integrated information theory of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Prior to joining Monash, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Nagoya Institute of Technology in Japan.
I worked on agent-based decision-making and large-scale multiagent simulation.

<p>
	I am interested in the following topics (amongst other things):

	<ul>
		<li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and formal model of general intelligence.</li>

		<li>Enactive cognition and constructivist epistemology.</li>

		<li>Multiagent simulation of complex systems: road traffic, weather conditions, motion, etc.</li>

		<li>Consensus algorithms and distributed ledgers.</li>
		
		<li>Automated negotiation with nonlinear preferences.</li>
		
		<li>Machine Consciousness.</li>
	</ul>
