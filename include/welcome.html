In December 2020, I joined the Department of Social Informatics at Kyoto University.

<p>
From September 2019 to December 2020, I was a researcher at the Nagoya Institute of Technology. I was developing conversational AI using Natural Language Processing/Generation, Sentiment Analysis, and Formal Argumentation. From April 2017, I was a research fellow in the departments of Psychology and Philosophy at Monash University. My work was at the intersection of AI, Neuroscience, and Philosophy. I mainly worked on 4E cognition, active inference, and the integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness.

	I am mostly working on the following topics:

	<li>Conversational multiagent systems and their applications to [online deliberation](https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2022/pdfs/p1794.pdf) and [voting](https://compsoc.algocratic.org/)</li>

	<li>Multiagent simulation of complex systems, with the focus on road traffic, urbanism, and social networks</li>			
		
	<li>Automated decision-making, with the focus on preference elicitation and automated negotiation</li>
	
	<li>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) and formal models of intelligence (Category Theory)</li>
	
	<li>Enactive AI, 4E cognition, constructivist epistemology, and consciousness research</li>
	
</ul>
