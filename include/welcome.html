<p>
In December 2020, I joined the Department of Social Informatics at Kyoto University.
</p>

<p>
From September 2019 to December 2020 I was a researcher at the Nagoya Institute of Technology. I worked on the development of argumentative conversational AI using Natural Language Processing/Generation, Sentiment Analysis, and Formal Argumentation.

<p>
Previously, I was a research fellow in the departments of Psychology and Philosophy at Monash University. My work was at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience and Philosophy, mostly studying how cognitive abilities rise in humans, animals, and machines.
I particularly worked on 4E cognition, active inference, and the integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness.
