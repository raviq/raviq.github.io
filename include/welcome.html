In December 2020, I joined the Department of Social Informatics at Kyoto University.

<p>
From September 2019 to December 2020, I was a researcher at the Nagoya Institute of Technology. I was developing conversational AI using Natural Language Processing/Generation, Sentiment Analysis, and Formal Argumentation. From April 2017, I was a research fellow in the departments of Psychology and Philosophy at Monash University. My work was at the intersection of AI, Neuroscience, and Philosophy. I mainly worked on 4E cognition, active inference, and the integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness.

	I am interested in the following topics:
	<li>Conversational multiagent systems and their applications to <a href="https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2022/pdfs/p1794.pdf">online deliberation</a> and <a href="https://compsoc.algocratic.org/">voting</a>.</li>
        <li>Multiagent simulation of complex systems, focusing on road traffic, urbanism, and social networks.</li>
	<li>Automated decision-making, focusing on preference elicitation and automated negotiation.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.kura.kyoto-u.ac.jp/assets/KU_Meet_Your_Community_Feb2023_Rafik.pdf">Enactive AI, 4E cognition</a>, autonomy, consciousness, and constructivist epistemology.</li>
	<li>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07307">formal models of intelligence</a>.</li>
</ul>
