            <h2>Human-Centric Autonomy from Agentic Dynamics</h2>
                      
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Countries are actively working towards establishing fundamental principles to guide the development of ethical and trustworthy AI systems. Among these principles, one principle that particularly stands out is respect for human autonomy (Figure 1). Despite its significance, no viable definition of autonomy adequately addresses this objective. This raises the question of how we can safely incorporate this concept into artificial agents, enabling them to interact with humans while respecting their autonomy. An enhanced understanding of autonomy will not only help develop ethical AI systems but could answer profound questions on free will, agency, and self-determination.</p>

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            This project attempts to build autonomy from axiomatic philosophical principles instead of the goal-driven approaches where autonomy is merely an algorithmic byproduct. The three main objectives are:
            <ul> 
               <li>Mathematically quantifying the autonomy of any system (Figure 2).</li>
               <li>Identifying the strategic conditions that could undermine or enhance autonomy.</li>
               <li>Experimentally testing autonomy with human and artificial agents.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The project is funded by a JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), project number 23K28145ã€€<a href="https://kaken.nii.ac.jp/en/grant/KAKENHI-PROJECT-23K28145/" class="button-white" target="_blank">https://kaken.nii.ac.jp/en/grant/KAKENHI-PROJECT-23H03455/</a>
