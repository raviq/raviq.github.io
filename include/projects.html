<p><h3>Human-Centric Autonomy from Agentic Dynamics</h3></p>

<p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid red;">
<h5>Vision</h5>
A deeper understanding of autonomy is crucial for developing ethical AIs and exploring more profound questions about free will, intelligence, and consciousness.
</p>

<p><h5>Background of the project</h5></p>

Countries strive to set the foundational principles for developing Ethical and trustworthy AI. The respect for human autonomy comes as a first requirement central to ethical principles. Despite its importance, no standard formalization of autonomy had been put forward for this purpose. How can this elusive concept be built into artificial agents that can interact with humans while respecting their autonomy?

This project attempts to build autonomy from axiomatic philosophical principles instead of goal-driven approaches where autonomy is merely an algorithmic byproduct. 
The project advances AI research by casting "true" autonomy onto the agent paradigm, advancing ethical AI development, and shedding light on foundational scientific questions such as agency, determinism, or free will.

<p><h5>Objectives</h5></p>

I propose to tackle the challenges posed by the project by 

  <ul> 
  <li>Mathematically quantifying the autonomy of any system (figure 2)</li>
  <li>Identifying the strategic conditions that could undermine or enhance its autonomy</li>
  <li>Experimentally testing autonomy with human and artificial agents</li>
  </ul>
