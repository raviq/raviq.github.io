            <h2>Human-Centric Autonomy from Agentic Dynamics</h2>
                      
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Countries strive to set the foundational principles for developing ethical and trustworthy AI. The respect for human autonomy comes as a first requirement central to ethical principles. Despite its importance, no standard formalization of autonomy had been put forward for this purpose. How can this elusive concept be built into artificial agents that can interact with humans while respecting their autonomy?
                A deeper understanding of autonomy is crucial for developing ethical AIs and exploring profound questions on free will, agency, or self-determination.</p>

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            This project attempts to build autonomy from axiomatic philosophical principles instead of the goal-driven approaches where autonomy is merely an algorithmic byproduct. The three main objectives are:
            <ul> 
               <li>Mathematically quantifying the autonomy of any system.</li>
               <li>Identifying the strategic conditions that could undermine or enhance autonomy.</li>
               <li>Experimentally testing autonomy with human and artificial agents.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The project is funded by a JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), project number 23H03455.<br>
