# Portfolio website

A very basic portfolio in html.

## Usage

- Edit the `sidemenu` div entries in `index.html` and create the corresponding pages in `include/`.
- Test by adding the site to `public/`, running [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) using `http-server -p 8000`, and accessing `http://localhost:8000/`.
